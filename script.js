                    <p>An AI Agent is a software entity that can perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously. It uses artificial intelligence techniques to understand its environment, make decisions, 
                    and take actions to achieve specific goals.</p>
                    <p>When we talk about AI Agents, we often think about their capabilities, such as natural language processing, machine learning, and computer vision. 
                    These capabilities enable AI Agents to interact with users and their environment in meaningful ways.</p>
                    <h2>What is Openclaw?</h2>
                    <p>Openclaw is a fully free-to-use (Open Source) framework for building AI Agents in many chat platforms.</p>
                    <p>With Openclaw, you can create AI Agents that can interact with users in various chat platforms, such as Slack, Discord, and Microsoft Teams.</p>

                    <h2>Understanding basic between UI and UX</h2>
                    <p>UI is a visual representation of the system, while UX encompasses the overall experience a user has with the system.
                    in other words, UI is about the look and feel of the product, while UX is about the functionality and user journey.</p>
                    <p>When we talking about UI stuff, it genuiely have connection between the interface and the experience. Making a perfect UI
                    itself it's not too hard while thinking about the experience user that would be effected around that.</p>
                    <h2>How they kill each other?</h2>
                    <p>They killing each other it's quite simple, just like knive with two eyes.</p>
                    <p>First, knive itself can kill people. In this UI and UX cases, when they have a really perfection UI but they have so much resource to load,
                    it would be affected hard with the UX itself. So, user can't experience the best in that app.</p>
                    <p>Second, knive itself can chop some "vegetable". In this UI and UX cases, this knive can help anything. For an example, when
                    we talk about a simple and minimalist UI, the experience itself quite simple too!. So, the app can driven a good experience and smooth
                    between the system and the user.

                    <p>In this Workshop, me with my friend curious about the title. Why we curious? simple. "Building forms with AI"? 
                    so we gonna prompting this? why?</p>
                    <p>After i explore the workshop, i just found what we gonna do. We are <strong>NOT ACTUALLY</strong> building
                    forms with AI, but we <strong>INSERT LOCAL AI</strong> in our forms code, This is was a experimental use from google
                    to test local AI that can generate fill in the form that we've made! it's took a long time to spend downloading Local AI (Gemma).</p>

                    <p><strong>This talkshow was insane tech.</strong> Why i wrote like this? I dont even know what the in the earth is <strong>GEOSPATIAL AI.</strong></p>
                    <p>After i listen the talkshow, i just realize this kinda tech was a new and revolutioner for business impact. Geospatial AI is a GPS AI that can searching
                    place as simple as searching in google maps. It was fun because if you wanna start your business, you gonna survey that place before build something!
                    But with this Geospatial AI, you can survey with AI stuff and research are that place is potentialy making money at the place that you wanna survey
                    (in terms of Geographical, Total population etc).<p>
                    <h4>Talkshow : Optimising Classification Tasks with Gemma</h4>

                    a good solution as not all local LLM can 100% perfect.</p>
